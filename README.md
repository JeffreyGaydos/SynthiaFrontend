# Synthia Music App v0.0.4
The React Native Frontend for the Synthia Music App, utilizing the database generated from the [MusicDatabaseGenerator](https://github.com/JeffreyGaydos/music-database-generator). Originally created to get over the limit of 1000 songs for Samsung Music.

# WIP
Here's what I have so far:
- Playlist UI, but no data and no tracklist
- A Player that can play a subset of songs found on your device (for testing purposes)
  - Includes play pause and progress bar. Other buttons are dummy buttons and will be worked on later
